1) As a user I want to be able to add the products I am interested in to a wishlist so that I can keep track of them.
2) As a user I want to be able to get in touch with sellers so that we can discuss terms of sale and get more information about products’ status.
3) As a user I want to be able to buy products without using real money so that I don’t need to use a payment method.
